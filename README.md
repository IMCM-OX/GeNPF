The goal of General Purpose Functions (GeNPF) is to offer user define
functions for a seamless yet standardized workflow for working with data
between google bucket and Terra persistent disk within Institute of
Molecular and Computational Medicine (IMCM).

The main goal of {GeNPF} is to achieve a painless pull and push of data
between workspaces and Rstudio interactive environment, saving time for
analysis and data exploration. Itâ€™s a wrapper around `gsutil` and other
tools to work with data in the cloud.

You can install the development version of GeNPF from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IMCM-OX/GeNPF")
